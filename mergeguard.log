🧠 Analysis

Since there are no changes detected in the remote repository, and all local files have been modified, this is a potential merge conflict scenario. The analysis suggests that the local changes may not be compatible with the remote repository.

⚔️ Conflict Resolution Strategy

Please choose a strategy to resolve the conflicts:

- Accept Remote: Run `git pull` and manually resolve any conflicts.
- Keep Local: During a merge conflict, run `git checkout --ours <file>` and then `git add <file>`. Complete the merge with `git commit`.
- Manual Merge: Run `git pull` and manually resolve conflict markers in affected files.
