## MergeGuard
MergeGuard is an AI teammate for developers working on GitHub projects.
It automatically scans your local repo, detects the linked GitHub repository, compares your current branch with the remote branch, retrieves commits, diffs, and file contents, and then explains the status in simple English — so you always know whether you’re behind, ahead, or in conflict risk.
